# Minecraft Scripts

These scripts are the beginning of the creation of a control panel.

# Design

## FrontEnd
No front end at this point in time. TODO

# Backend
Planning on using NodeJS for this. For now, it's all bash scripts.

## Usage
### Install Minecraft w/ Forge
The `installmcForge.sh` script will find the latest version of Vanilla Minecraft Server and Forge server and install them. It will also install any needed dependencies such as Java and Tmux.
